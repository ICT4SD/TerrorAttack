# TerrorAttack

Interactive visual implementation system for analysing global terrorism attacks

Project Objective
------------

This project provides an Interactive Visual Implementation System (IVIS) of the global terrorism attacks, to better support the researchers with deeper understandings of the patterns and regularities of the current world terrorism conflicts. This system seeks and presents potential correlations, clustering performances and feature rankings of different countries and parties, associated with types of attacks and casualties.
